# Alchemy

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/sam-goodwin/alchemy)

Alchemy is an embeddable, TypeScript-native Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) library for modeling Resources that are Created, Updated and Deleted automatically. It's like Terraform, but in pure TypeScript.

Unlike similar tools like Pulumi, Terraform, and CloudFormation, Alchemy is implemented in pure ESM-native TypeScript code with zero dependencies.

Resources are simple memoized async functions that can run in any JavaScript runtime, including the browser, serverless functions and durable workflows.

```ts
import alchemy from "alchemy";

// initialize the app (with default state $USER)
const app = await alchemy("cloudflare-worker");

// create a Cloudflare Worker
export const worker = await Worker("worker", {
  name: "my-worker",
  entrypoint: "./src/index.ts",
  bindings: {
    COUNTER: counter,
    STORAGE: storage,
    AUTH_STORE: authStore,
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: alchemy.secret(process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID),
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET: alchemy.secret(process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET),
  },
});

// finalize the alchemy app (triggering deletion of orphaned resources)
await app.finalize();
```

# Features

- **JS-native** - no second language, toolchains, dependencies, processes, services, etc. to lug around.
- **Async-native** - resources are just async functions - no complex abstraction to learn.
- **ESM-native** - built exclusively on ESM, with a slight preference for modern JS runtimes like Bun.
- **Embeddable** - runs in any JavaScript/TypeScript environment, including the browser!
- **Extensible** - implement your own resources with a simple function.
- **AI-first** - alchemy actively encourages you to use LLMs to create/copy/fork/modify resources to fit your needs. No more waiting around for a provider to be implemented, just do it yourself in a few minutes.
- **No dependencies** - the `alchemy` core package has 0 required dependencies.
- **No service** - state files are stored locally in your project and can be easily inspected, modified, checked into your repo, etc.
- **No strong opinions** - structure your codebase however you want, store state anywhere - we don't care!
