            Please review this pull request and provide comprehensive feedback. Focus on:

            1. Code quality and best practices
            2. Potential bugs or issues
            3. Performance considerations
            4. Security concerns
            5. Test coverage and quality
            6. Documentation and comments
            7. Adherence to the project's coding standards (see CLAUDE.md if available)

            For Alchemy-specific code:
            - Ensure proper use of alchemy.secret() instead of new Secret()
            - Check that dependencies are added as peer dependencies
            - Verify Resource naming conventions (interface and export names must match)
            - Confirm proper phase handling in Resource implementations
            - Validate test structure and cleanup patterns

            Provide constructive feedback with specific suggestions for improvement.
            If the changes look good, mention that as well.

            Be thorough but concise in your review.
