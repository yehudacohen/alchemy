# Durable Object

This guide explains how to create, bind and use Cloudflare Durable Objects within your Worker scripts.

> [!TIP]
> We assume you're familiar with Cloudflare Durable Objects already. If not, read [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) first.

## Create a Durable Object Namespace

At a bare minimum, you need to create a `DurableObjectNamespace` object as a stable reference to your Durable Object namespace.

```ts
import { DurableObjectNamespace } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const counter = new DurableObjectNamespace("counter", {
  className: "Counter",
  // whether you want a sqllite db per DO (usually yes!)
  sqlite: true
});
```

If you're paying close attention, you'll notice that we call `new DurableObjectNamespace` instead of `await DurableObjectNamespace` like you might have come to expect from Alchemy Resources.

This is because of oddities in Cloudflare's API design. Durable Object namespaces are not resources in the traditional sense because they cannot exist without a Worker.

## Bind the Durable Object to a Worker

Instead, you create a Durable Object namespace and then bind it to your Worker:

```ts
export const worker = await Worker("Worker", {
  name: "my-worker",
  entrypoint: "./index.ts"
  bindings: {
    // bind the Durable Object namespace to your Worker
    COUNTER: counter,
  },
});
```

## Implement the Durable Object class

Now, we have a Worker with a Durable Object running within it. To use this Durable Object, our Worker script must include a class for the Durable Object and then some code in the `fetch` handler to interact with it.

A simple Durable Object may look like so:

```ts
export class Counter {
  private state: DurableObjectState;
  private count: number;

  constructor(state, env) {
    this.state = state;
    this.count = 0;
  }

  async fetch(request) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const path = url.pathname;

    // Retrieve current count
    this.count = await this.state.storage.get("count") || 0;

    if (path === "/increment") {
      this.count++;
      await this.state.storage.put("count", this.count);
    } else if (path === "/decrement") {
      this.count--;
      await this.state.storage.put("count", this.count);
    }

    return Response.json({ count: this.count });
  }
}
```

> See Cloudflare's [Durable Objects Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/get-started/) for more details on implementing Durable Objects.

## Access the Durable Object from your Worker

Now, our `fetch` handler can get a Durable Object instance via the `COUNTER` binding:

```ts
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    
    // Create an ID for the Counter (different IDs = different Counter instances)
    const id = env.COUNTER.idFromName("A");
    
    // Get a stub for the Counter instance
    const stub = env.COUNTER.get(id);
    
    // Forward the request to the Durable Object
    return stub.fetch(request);
  },
};
```

## Type-safe Bindings

Remember, for `env.` to be type-safe, you need to configure your `src/env.d.ts` to infer the types from your worker:

```ts
// src/env.d.ts
import type { worker } from "./alchemy.run";

export type WorkerEnv = typeof worker.Env;

declare module "cloudflare:workers" {
  namespace Cloudflare {
    export interface Env extends WorkerEnv {}
  }
}
```

## Cross-Script Durable Object Binding

You can share Durable Objects across multiple Workers, allowing one Worker to access Durable Object instances defined in another Worker. This enables powerful patterns for building distributed systems where different Workers can coordinate through shared state.

### Method 1: Using re-exported syntax

You can directly reference the Durable Object binding from the provider Worker:

```ts
import { Worker, DurableObjectNamespace } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

// Create the provider Worker with the Durable Object
const host = await Worker("Host", {
  entrypoint: "./do-provider.ts", 
  bindings: {
    SHARED_COUNTER: new DurableObjectNamespace("shared-counter", {
      className: "SharedCounter",
      sqlite: true,
    }),
  },
});

// Create the client Worker using the provider's Durable Object binding directly
const client = await Worker("client", {
  entrypoint: "./client-worker.ts",
  bindings: {
    // Re-use the exact same Durable Object binding from the provider worker
    SHARED_COUNTER: host.bindings.SHARED_COUNTER,
  },
});
```

### Method 2: Using `scriptName` directly

Alternatively, when creating a Durable Object binding in a client Worker, you can reference a Durable Object defined in another Worker by specifying the `scriptName`:

```ts
import { Worker, DurableObjectNamespace } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const hostWorkerName = "host"

const durableObject = new DurableObjectNamespace("shared-counter", {
  className: "SharedCounter",
  scriptName: hostWorkerName,
  sqlite: true,
});

// First, create the Worker that defines the Durable Object
const host = await Worker("host", {
  entrypoint: "./do-provider.ts",
  name: hostWorkerName,
  bindings: {
    // Define the Durable Object in this worker
    SHARED_COUNTER: durableObject,
  },
});

// Then, create a client Worker that uses the cross-script Durable Object
const client = await Worker("client", {
  entrypoint: "./client-worker.ts",
  bindings: {
    // Reference the same Durable Object but specify which script it comes from
    SHARED_COUNTER: durableObject,
  },
});
```

### Durable Object Provider Implementation

The provider Worker implements the Durable Object class and optionally provides endpoints:

```ts
// do-provider.ts
export class SharedCounter {
  private state: DurableObjectState;
  private counter: number;

  constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: any) {
    this.state = state;
    this.counter = 0;
  }

  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    
    // Retrieve current count from durable storage
    this.counter = await this.state.storage.get("count") || 0;

    if (url.pathname === "/increment") {
      this.counter++;
      await this.state.storage.put("count", this.counter);
      
      return Response.json({
        action: "increment",
        counter: this.counter,
        worker: "do-provider"
      });
    }

    if (url.pathname === "/get") {
      return Response.json({
        action: "get", 
        counter: this.counter,
        worker: "do-provider"
      });
    }

    return new Response("SharedCounter DO is running!", { status: 200 });
  }
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    return new Response('DO Provider Worker is running!');
  }
};
```

### Client Worker Implementation

The client Worker can access the shared Durable Object without implementing the Durable Object class:

```ts
// client-worker.ts
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    
    if (url.pathname === '/increment') {
      try {
        // Access the Durable Object defined in another worker
        const id = env.SHARED_COUNTER.idFromName('global-counter');
        const stub = env.SHARED_COUNTER.get(id);
        const response = await stub.fetch(new Request('https://example.com/increment'));
        const data = await response.json();
        
        return Response.json({
          success: true,
          clientWorker: 'client-worker',
          result: data,
          crossScriptWorking: true
        });
      } catch (error) {
        return Response.json({
          error: error.message,
          crossScriptWorking: false
        }, { status: 500 });
      }
    }

    if (url.pathname === '/get') {
      try {
        // Get the current counter value
        const id = env.SHARED_COUNTER.idFromName('global-counter');
        const stub = env.SHARED_COUNTER.get(id);
        const response = await stub.fetch(new Request('https://example.com/get'));
        const data = await response.json();
        
        return Response.json({
          success: true,
          clientWorker: 'client-worker',
          result: data
        });
      } catch (error) {
        return Response.json({
          error: error.message
        }, { status: 500 });
      }
    }

    return new Response('Client Worker is running!');
  }
};
```
