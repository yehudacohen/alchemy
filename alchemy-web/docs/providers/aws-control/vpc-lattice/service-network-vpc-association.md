# ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation

The ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation resource lets you manage associations between Amazon VPCs and service networks in AWS VpcLattice. This resource allows you to enable communication between your VPCs and services defined in a service network. For more details, refer to the [AWS VpcLattice ServiceNetworkVpcAssociations documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpclattice/latest/userguide/).

## Minimal Example

Create a basic ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation with the required properties:

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const serviceNetworkVpcAssociation = await AWS.VpcLattice.ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation("myVpcAssociation", {
  ServiceNetworkIdentifier: "sn-1234567890abcdef0",
  VpcIdentifier: "vpc-0ab12345cdef67890",
  SecurityGroupIds: ["sg-0123456789abcdef0"]
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation with additional tags for better resource management:

```ts
const advancedVpcAssociation = await AWS.VpcLattice.ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation("advancedVpcAssociation", {
  ServiceNetworkIdentifier: "sn-0987654321fedcba0",
  VpcIdentifier: "vpc-0ab12345cdef67890",
  SecurityGroupIds: ["sg-0123456789abcdef0"],
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "Production" },
    { Key: "Project", Value: "ProjectX" }
  ]
});
```

## Adopting an Existing Association

Use the adopt option to manage an existing service network VPC association without failing if it already exists:

```ts
const adoptVpcAssociation = await AWS.VpcLattice.ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation("adoptExistingVpcAssociation", {
  ServiceNetworkIdentifier: "sn-11223344556677889",
  VpcIdentifier: "vpc-0ab12345cdef67890",
  SecurityGroupIds: ["sg-0123456789abcdef0"],
  adopt: true
});
```

## Including Multiple Security Groups

Create a ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation with multiple security groups for enhanced security:

```ts
const multiSecurityGroupVpcAssociation = await AWS.VpcLattice.ServiceNetworkVpcAssociation("multiSecurityGroupVpcAssociation", {
  ServiceNetworkIdentifier: "sn-22334455667788990",
  VpcIdentifier: "vpc-0ab12345cdef67890",
  SecurityGroupIds: [
    "sg-0123456789abcdef0",
    "sg-abcdef01234567890"
  ]
});
```
