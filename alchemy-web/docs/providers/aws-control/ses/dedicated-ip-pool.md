# DedicatedIpPool

The DedicatedIpPool resource allows you to manage dedicated IP pools for Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), enabling better deliverability and control over your sending reputation. For more information, see the [AWS SES DedicatedIpPools documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/userguide/).

## Minimal Example

Create a basic dedicated IP pool with a specified name:

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const dedicatedIpPool = await AWS.SES.DedicatedIpPool("myIpPool", {
  PoolName: "MyDedicatedIpPool",
  ScalingMode: "MANAGED"
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a dedicated IP pool with additional options, including the ability to adopt an existing resource:

```ts
const advancedIpPool = await AWS.SES.DedicatedIpPool("advancedIpPool", {
  PoolName: "AdvancedDedicatedIpPool",
  ScalingMode: "MANAGED",
  adopt: true
});
```

## Adoption of Existing Pool

This example demonstrates how to adopt an existing dedicated IP pool without failing if it already exists:

```ts
const adoptExistingIpPool = await AWS.SES.DedicatedIpPool("existingIpPool", {
  PoolName: "ExistingDedicatedIpPool",
  adopt: true
});
```

## Status and Metadata Retrieval

After creating a dedicated IP pool, you can access its metadata, such as ARN and creation time:

```ts
const ipPoolMetadata = await AWS.SES.DedicatedIpPool("metadataIpPool", {
  PoolName: "MetadataDedicatedIpPool"
});

// Accessing metadata
console.log("Pool ARN:", ipPoolMetadata.Arn);
console.log("Creation Time:", ipPoolMetadata.CreationTime);
console.log("Last Updated:", ipPoolMetadata.LastUpdateTime);
```
