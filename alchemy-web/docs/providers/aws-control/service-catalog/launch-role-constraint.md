# LaunchRoleConstraint

The LaunchRoleConstraint resource allows you to manage the launch role constraints for AWS Service Catalog products. This enables you to specify the IAM role that users can assume when launching a product from a portfolio. For more information, visit the [AWS ServiceCatalog LaunchRoleConstraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/userguide/) documentation.

## Minimal Example

Create a basic LaunchRoleConstraint specifying the portfolio ID, product ID, and a role ARN.

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const launchRoleConstraint = await AWS.ServiceCatalog.LaunchRoleConstraint("basicLaunchRoleConstraint", {
  PortfolioId: "portfolio-12345678",
  ProductId: "product-87654321",
  RoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/LaunchRole",
  Description: "Launch role constraint for my product."
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a LaunchRoleConstraint with additional options such as accept language and a local role name.

```ts
const advancedLaunchRoleConstraint = await AWS.ServiceCatalog.LaunchRoleConstraint("advancedLaunchRoleConstraint", {
  PortfolioId: "portfolio-87654321",
  ProductId: "product-12345678",
  RoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AdvancedLaunchRole",
  LocalRoleName: "AdvancedLaunchRoleName",
  AcceptLanguage: "en"
});
```

## Adopting Existing Resources

If you want to adopt an existing LaunchRoleConstraint without failing if it already exists, you can set the adopt property to true.

```ts
const adoptExistingLaunchRoleConstraint = await AWS.ServiceCatalog.LaunchRoleConstraint("adoptLaunchRoleConstraint", {
  PortfolioId: "portfolio-12345678",
  ProductId: "product-87654321",
  RoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AdoptLaunchRole",
  adopt: true
});
```
