# QueueConsumer

Creates a consumer for a [Cloudflare Queue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/platform/consumers/) that processes messages using a Worker.

# Minimal Example

Create a basic queue consumer with default settings.

```ts
import { Queue, QueueConsumer } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const queue = await Queue("notifications", {
  name: "notifications"
});

const consumer = await QueueConsumer("notification-processor", {
  queue,
  scriptName: "notification-worker"
});
```

# Custom Settings

Configure batch size, concurrency, retries and other settings.

```ts
import { Queue, QueueConsumer } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const consumer = await QueueConsumer("batch-processor", {
  queue,
  scriptName: "batch-worker", 
  settings: {
    batchSize: 50,         // Process 50 messages at once
    maxConcurrency: 10,    // Allow 10 concurrent invocations
    maxRetries: 5,         // Retry failed messages up to 5 times
    maxWaitTimeMs: 2000,   // Wait up to 2 seconds to fill a batch
    retryDelay: 60         // Wait 60 seconds before retrying failed messages
  }
});
```

# Bind to a Worker

Bind a queue consumer to a worker.

```ts
import { Worker, QueueConsumer } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const consumer = await QueueConsumer("my-consumer", {
  queue,
  scriptName: "my-worker"
});

await Worker("my-worker", {
  name: "my-worker",
  script: "console.log('Hello, world!')",
  bindings: {
    myConsumer: consumer
  }
});
```
