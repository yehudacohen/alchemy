# Queue

The Queue component lets you add [Cloudflare Queue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/) to your app for reliable message delivery between workers.

## Minimal Example

Create a basic queue with default settings.

```ts
import { Queue } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const queue = await Queue("my-queue", {
  name: "my-queue"
});
```

## Queue with Custom Settings

Configure queue behavior with delivery delay and message retention.

```ts
import { Queue } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const queue = await Queue("delayed-queue", {
  name: "delayed-queue",
  settings: {
    deliveryDelay: 30, // 30 second delay
    messageRetentionPeriod: 86400, // Store messages for 1 day
    deliveryPaused: false
  }
});
```

## Bind to a Worker

Attach a queue to a worker for processing messages.

```ts
import { Worker, Queue } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const queue = await Queue("my-queue", {
  name: "my-queue"
});

await Worker("my-worker", {
  name: "my-worker", 
  script: "console.log('Hello, world!')",
  bindings: {
    MY_QUEUE: queue
  }
});
```
