# Phase

An Alchemy app can run in one of three phases:
1. `"up"` - resources should be created, updated and deleted as necessary.
2. `"destroy"` - all resources in the stage should be deleted and the program should not proceed
3. `"read"` - run the program end-to-end but do not create, update or delete any resources

## `"up"`

The **Up** phase creates, updates and deletes resources. This is the default mode and the most common. It's how you deploy your app (synchronize resources).

```ts
const app = await alchemy("my-app", {
  phase: "up"
});

const worker = await Worker("my-app", { .. }); // <- will be created or updated

await app.finalize(); // <- will delete orphaned resources
```

## `"destroy"`

The **Destroy** phase deletes all resources and scopes within the `my-app.${stage}` (e.g. `prod` below).

```ts
const app = await alchemy("my-app", {
  phase: "destroy",
  stage: "prod", // <- this stage will be destroyed
});

// execution will not proceed to the following lines

const worker = await Worker("my-app", { .. }); // <- never executed
```

## `"read"`

The **Read** phase runs the program but never creates, updates or deletes any resources. It is useful for building shell scripts that need access to infrastructure properties (e.g. the )

```ts
const app = await alchemy("my-app", {
  phase: "read"
});

// will reconstruct itself from state and error if it does not exist
const worker = await Worker("my-app", { .. });

worker.url; // <- populated from `.alchemy/` state

await app.finalize() // <- will not delete any orphaned resources
```

> [!TIP]
> You can write your own scripts that run commands and pass infrstructure properties as environment variables with a very simple node script.
> 1. Set the `phase` to `"read"`, e.g. using an env variable:
> ```ts
> // ./alchemy.run.ts
> const app = await alchemy({
>   phase: process.env.PHASE ?? "up"    
> });
>
> // export your infrastructure
> export const website = await Worker(..);
> ```
> 2. Import the `website` from your `alchemy.run.ts` module and execute a shell command. `alchemy/os` exposes a convenient async exec command that inherits stdio by default, but you can use anything.
> ```ts
> // ./scripts/build.ts
> import { exec } from "alchemy/os";
> import { website } from "./alchemy.run";
> 
> await exec("astro build", {
>   BACKEND_URL: website.url    
> })
> ```
> 3. Finally, execute your command `bash`:
> ```sh
> PHASE=read bun ./scripts/build.ts
> ```
