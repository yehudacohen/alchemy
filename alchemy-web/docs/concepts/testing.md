# Testing

Alchemy resources are easy to test since they're just functions, but Alchemy also offers a simple `alchemy.test` utility to help isolate your [Scopes](../concepts/scope.md) for each test suite.

## Test Setup

Import alchemy's test utility and your resource:

```typescript
import { describe, expect } from "bun:test";
import alchemy, { destroy } from "alchemy";
import { Database } from "../src/neon/database";

// make sure to augment `alchemy` by importing your preferred testing utility
import "alchemy/test/bun";
```

## Test Scope Creation

Create a `test` function at the top of your test suite:

```typescript
// Create test scope using filename
const test = alchemy.test(import.meta);
```

We pass `import.meta` so that all the resources created in this test suite will be isolated from other tests.

## Resource Test Implementation

Now, create a test as you ordinarily would:

```typescript
test("create, update, and delete database", async (scope) => {
  // ..
});
```

Note how our test is passed a `scope` value - we'll use that at the end to clean up our resources.

Inside our test, we can simple create and update our resources, make assertions, etc.:
```ts
// Create resource
let database = await Database(testId, {
  name: `${testId}-db`,
  // Other required properties...
});

// Test assertions
expect(database.id).toBeTruthy();

// Update resource
database = await Database(testId, {
  // Updated properties...
});
```

Finally, wrap all of this in a `try-finally` so that we can ensure our test resources are cleaned up.

```ts
try {
  // (create, update and assertions)
} finally {
  // delete all resources
  await destroy(scope);
  
  // Verify resource was deleted if you want to
}
```

> [!TIP]
> It's recommended to use a `try-finally` so that you can assert the resource was actually deleted.
